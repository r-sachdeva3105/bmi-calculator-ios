# BMI Calculator App
This app allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on two measurement systems: the SI (metric) system and the Imperial system. The app calculates BMI by taking the user's weight and height as inputs, then classifies the result into a BMI category (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity).
